## What did I learn about CSS?

I learned that there are three ways of entering a stylesheet. External, internal, and inline CSS.

## What is external CSS?

External CSS is an external stylesheet where you can change the look of an entire website by only changing one file.

## What is internal CSS?

Internal CSS may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined within the <style> element, inside the <head> section.

## What is inline CSS?

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS preperty.
